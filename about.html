            <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Scams</h2>

            <ul class="protection-tips">
                <li><strong>Verify Emails and Messages:</strong> Always double-check the sender’s email address and avoid clicking on suspicious links or attachments.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Ensure that you are using complex, unique passwords for each account, and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Software Up to Date:</strong> Regularly update your operating system, browsers, and security software to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Careful with Personal Information:</strong> Never share sensitive information (like credit card details or Social Security numbers) unless you're certain the request is legitimate.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Trusted Websites:</strong> Always ensure that a website is secure (look for “https” in the URL) before entering sensitive information.</li>
            </ul>
